# Replacing Front-End code

Users have the ability to replace all front-end code (JS, HTML, CSS, images...). In order to do that, create a folder called `ImpostorHQ.Overrides` and any subfolder that your file might require. Then, place your file there.

For example, if we wanted to replace `main.js`, we would create a file with the relative  path of `ImpostorHQ.Overrides/js/main.js`.
